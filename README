Reprise - As minimal a hAtom blog as possible

Note:

    Original fork from Eivind Uggedal's minimal blogging tool
    (see http://github.com/uggedal/reprise). This verion contains
    my personal preferences so it's probably better to check out
    the original git file.


  1. vi entries/YYYY.MM.DD.Entry.Title.in.Camel.Case
  2. Tag your entries by making the first line read:

       Tags: sometag anothertag lasttag

     The tag preamble should be followed by a blank line.
  3. For Ruby version:
       gem install BlueCloth rubypants haml ratom
     For Python version:
       easy_install markdown smartypants Jinja2 lxml Pygments
  4. ./reprise.rb or ./reprise.py
  5. Hook up public/ to a web server like nginx
  6. Rewrite requests from /.+/ to /.+\.html/:

       if (-f $request_filename.html) {
               rewrite (.*) $1.html break;
       }
